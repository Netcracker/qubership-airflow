Test image contains some DAGs for SVT testing. The DAGs are defined in [dynamic_svt_dag](/tests_dags_image/dags/dynamic_svt_dag.py) file. The DAGs consist of different number of `print` python tasks, and are named `dynamic_dag_x_y`, where x is the number of branches in the DAG, y is the length of each branch in the DAG, so overall the DAG has x*y tasks.

To test performance it is possible to start one or several of the dynamic DAGs. You can view the Task/DAG starting time and execution duration on the Airflow UI, for example, **DAG** > **Gantt**. You can also view the DAG metrics and resources consumed per pod on the Monitoring dashboard. It is also important to view the pod statuses and tasks run, for example, setting limits on the pods might result in pods to restart. Too many running processes that are processing tasks might result in PostgreSQL not having enough connections.
